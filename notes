BACKEND ARCHITECTURES
- monolithic Architecture
pros:-
simple to develop and deploy
easier to debug since everything in one place.

cons:-
can get messy as the app grows
scaling specific parts of the app can be tricky

microservice Architecture
in this application is broken down into smaller indepedent services
each service handle handle specific business function like authentication, payment. and it communicates with each other via api's

serverless architecture
it let you write code without worrying about the underlying infrasture your cloud provider like AWS Lambda,(verscel also)


SERVERLESS DATA  PLATFORM => UPSTASh
-redis
-vector
-Qstash

Duolingo use for automatic sending email
arcjet : it allows you secure your application
it allow to 
-rate limiting
- bot protection


middleWare 
express.json
errorhandlermiddleware
urlencoded
cookieParser

Routes
